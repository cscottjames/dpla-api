This web page will serve a random image based on the search string "Catholic University" (with quotes) from the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA). It will also have a link to the full catalog record from the source instutition. Of course, you can change the search string to any of your choice if you wish. This is purely for speculative purposes, and to illustrate the possible uses of library APIs.

In order for this to work, you first have to register for an API key, then save the key to the file "key.js" in the root directory of the repository.
